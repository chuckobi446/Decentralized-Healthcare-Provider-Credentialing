# Decentralized Healthcare Provider Credentialing

A blockchain-based platform for secure, efficient, and transparent verification of healthcare practitioner credentials across institutions and networks.

## Overview

The Decentralized Healthcare Provider Credentialing (DHPC) platform leverages blockchain technology to transform the traditionally fragmented, time-consuming, and redundant process of healthcare provider credentialing. By creating a secure, distributed system of verifiable credentials, the platform drastically reduces administrative burden, eliminates duplicate verification efforts, accelerates provider onboarding, and enhances credential security and trust. This system addresses the critical inefficiencies in healthcare that delay provider deployment, increase administrative costs, and create barriers to care delivery.
